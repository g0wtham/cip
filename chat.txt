With all these qualities he decided to commit himself to the society. And that single thought led him to be a bureaucrat  with all administrative principles of equality, equity,  impartiality and transparent decision making skills. This massive transition took various phases. He was district employment officer in erode for a year. Moreover he secured 25th rank in TNPSC. This concise story seems to mirror the life of our Alumini Mr.Vinoth, Deputy Superintendent of Police. Its a proud moment for all of us to have him back. So aspirants,  don't miss this inspirational talk organized by Students association of CEG.

Different cities,different countries...But the word CEG has united us all!!Now its time for the word "TAMIL" to take its chance!!
This jallikattu issue has brought an awareness among us about how corporates can influence us so much to the extent of making our culture go extinct.If we keep them live,the next issue of protest will be the water scarcity in Tamil nadu....Lets not make it happen!

*We the students of CEG* should enforce the adminstration  to consistently reduce the sale of MNC products within the campus....Its high time we stop the 
Nestea ice tea ,maggi in cafeteria , lays kurkure,dairy milk,tropicana and stuff in Gurunath and bring in some Indian goods to circulation!!
Our fellow students in MIT has already inched forward in this movement!!
Lets begin to spread the cause from the very moment to implement it!
